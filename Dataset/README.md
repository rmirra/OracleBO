# OracleBO Dataset
## Evaluation Parameters
In our experiments, we optimize the objective functions for:

- $f\_evals = 100$ function evaluations

- $r\_init = 5$ initial random samples after which the acquisition sampling begins

- $D = 2000, \mathbf{R}^N$ is the high-dimensional space

- $d = 4, \mathbf{R}^d$ is embedding space for $P1, P2, P3$, Branin and Rosenbrock

- d = 6 for Hartmann6 

- Branin, Rosenbrock, and Hartmann6 have effective dimensionality $d_e = 2, 4, 6$, respectively. 

- Different numbers of Oracle queries $L = {0, 1, 3, 5, 15, 30}$ are used and $L=0$ implies no Oracle queries are available and OracleBO functions as just ALEBO (Letham et al.2020)

- $q=5$ acquisition samples are used in Batch Acquisition function (BAF)


- In the Dimension Matched Sampler (DMS), we use variance $\sigma = 1$

- Rand $ = [0,1]$ are for Top $Q_d$ queries and Random $Q_d$ queries respectively

- For Branin, we use the minimizer $h^* = (pi,2.275)$ to generate $Q_d$ queries and for perception functions $P1,P2,P3$ we use the minimizer $h_i^*=0, i=1,2,\dots,N$. For Hartmann6 and Rosenbrock we use their unique minimizers.

- We run 10 random runs of each experiment
